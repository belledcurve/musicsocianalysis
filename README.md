/**
We believe that popular music is a great lens in viewing society at a given time, and expect this research to be extended to popular music scenes of other countries and/or regions. The reason this project focuses on Korean popular music and its society in specific, is because of the unique closure of the Korean society where most of its components of society are monoethnic (Koreans), and the noticeable economic/societal growth in the South Korean society throughout the late 20th century and early 21th century, which make conspicuous the differences in repeated themes in popular music throughout the given time periods.
