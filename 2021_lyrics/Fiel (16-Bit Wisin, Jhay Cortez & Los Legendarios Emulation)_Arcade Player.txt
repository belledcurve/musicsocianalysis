 Yeah On the low hangin with them ATL bomb droppers Gots to keep your heads up high like armed robbers With egos larger than Julia Roberts' lips and forehead Still managing to keep them whores spread My crew's dead weight you all said But we busy upgrading to boar's head from regular store brand My new name is F-U 2 That's my 2010 shorthand Got more support than (???) girders Guilty of them state-to-state murders Slayin everyone that ever heard us Put us on stage and it's curtains Gotta stay prepared cause the road ahead of us is uncertain I'm gettin ready for dark days Eatin chocolates until the earth starts to feel like an arcade I play the game well My girl said I got a little brain so I grew my afro, you can't tell 
 I'm just confident because my new brand's bout to run and take off like a toucan And after two cans of domestic beer I said we gotta get it right this year For the rest is clear See it's here for the takin, like old lady's purses The mastermind creatures getting biz with the verses So watch what you purchase, you might just get it Everything that you're askin for and even more like Get wit it or get lost You might as well make it a point to get raw We're sittin here pointin out all of your flaws While you're busy sayin nothin when you open your jaw SUCKA Just remember you saw Live footage of a cabbage we turned to cole slaw I told y'all Terror level's on red You only play the side of this meal like cornbreadJust remember you saw Live footage of a cabbage we turned to cole slaw 
 Just ease off the pedal a bit Shave it down and the better the fit Another audio steal for your ear canal We've got far to go but focus on the here and now So I'ma take a sharp point into your skull through your grey matter Give a little twist activate your brain matter With precise data, It's obviously a good fit to slide Johnny Depp as the mad hatter I'm at the bottom of this rabbit hole soul searchin Usin all these fragments to build a whole person And all these imperfect pieces can all stand alone and travel through the school of life And write their own thesis My universe is holographic It's gettin hard to make ATLean moves cause of all the traffic Too many people hoverin in my lanes so I'm about to go all terrain now 
 I'm gettin live now, my new brand's bout to run and take off like a toucan And if you're eating more fast food this year, I said you gotta get it right this year For the rest is clear See it's here for the takin, like souls in your churches The mastermind creatures big wyzsz with the verses So watch what you purchase, you might just get it Everything that you're askin for and even more like Get wit it or get lost You might as well make it a point to get raw We're sittin here pointin out all of your flaws While you're busy sayin nothin when you open your jaw SUCKA Just remember you saw Live footage of a cabbage we turned to cole slaw I told y'all Terror level's on red You only play the side of this meal like cornbread
