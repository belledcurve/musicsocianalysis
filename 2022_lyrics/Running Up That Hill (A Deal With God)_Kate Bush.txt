 It doesn't hurt me You want to feel how it feels You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me You want to hear about the deal that I'm making 
 You You and me 
 And if I only could I'd make a deal with God I'd get him to swap our places Be running up that road Be running up that hill Be running up that building If I only could, oh... 
 You don't want to hurt me But see how deep the bullet lies Unaware I'm tearing you asunder Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts, baby Is there so much hate for the ones we love? Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
 You You and me, won't be unhappy 
 And if I only could I'd make a deal with God I'd get him to swap our places Be running up that road Be running up that hill Be running up that building If I only could, oh... 
 Come on, baby Come on, come on, darling Let me steal this moment from you now Come on, angel Come on, come on, darling Let's exchange the experience, oh 
 And if I only could Make a deal with God I'd get him to swap our places I'd be running up that road Be running up that hill Be running up that building If I only could, oh If i only could, oh
