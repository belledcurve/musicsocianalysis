 Mmm, mmm, mmm 
 Flowers in hand, waiting for me Every word in poetry Won't call me by name,  only "baby" The more that you give, the less that I need Everyone says I look happy When it feels right 
 I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave I brought you down to your knees 'Cause they say that misery loves company It's not your fault I ruin everything And it's not your fault I can't be what you need Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me 
 I'm everything they said I would be La, la, la I'm everything they said I would be 
 I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye Before you let go, just one more time Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine A little more hurt won't kill you Tonight, mother says you don't look happy Close your eyes
 I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave I brought you down to your knees 'Cause they say that misery loves company It's not your fault I ruin everything And it's not your fault I can't be what you need Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me 
 I'm everything they said I would be La, la, la, la La, la, la La, la, la Oh, ah, ah Ah, oh Ah, oh 
 I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave I brought you down to your knees 'Cause they say that misery loves company It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything) And it's not your fault I can't be what you need Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh
 Angels like you can't fly down here with me
